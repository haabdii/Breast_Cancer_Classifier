# Breast_Cancer_Classifier

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. 
It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 million people in 2015 alone. 
It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. 
These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenge is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous). 
In this portfolio project, I use Python and machine learning best practices to build a breast cancer classifier. 
I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
